# Homework 6

In this homework we are going to build a Todo List Application using React.

* You need to have a input box for user to create a new todo.
* You need to show all the todo in the page.
* For each single todo, you can single click to mark it done.
* You need to have three filters for your todo list: all, active, and completed, which means when you select the `completed` filter you should only see the completed todos, etc.
* Go [here](https://1vwm785r44.codesandbox.io/) to get the general idea about the todo list, but please make yours pretty :)
