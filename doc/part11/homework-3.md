# Homework 3

Build simple timer web application using React:

* You need to have a UI to show the current number in the timer.
* You need to have a button to toggle the timer. If the time has not started yet or has been stopped, the text on the button should be "start". Otherwise the text should be "stop".
* You need to have a reset button to reset the number of the time to 0. Please note that if you press the reset button while the timer is running, the time should not stop and will start from 0 again.
* Suppose that you started the timer and stopped it at 3 (second), when you start the timer again without reset, the timer should continue running start from 3.

This is what we are going to build. Again if you don't have the extra time on styling and css, that's totally fine. Just focus on the core React part and keep the UI as simple as possible.
